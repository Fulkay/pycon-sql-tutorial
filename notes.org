* JOIN
** Movies <= 1899, with # of actors
   Need LEFT OUTER JOIN
** Query: movies <= 1899, with their most popular actor
   Solution is to create a *subquery*
** LEFT OUTER JOIN and importance of where criteria go
   select * from movie join role on (movie.id = movie_id)
     where title = 'Happiness' 
       and role.name like '%Himself%';
   select * from movie left outer join role
     on (movie.id = movie_id)
     where title = 'Happiness'
       and role.name like '%Himself%';
   select * from movie left outer join role on
     (movie.id = movie_id and role.name like '%Himself%')
     where title = 'Happiness';
* raw data structures : objects :: DB-API : ORM
** ugly_and_not.py
*** also print out role.actor.name and count queries
        for role in session.query(Role).filter_by(
            movie=movie).options(joinedload('actor')
            ):
